        <div class="subheading mb-5">History</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a history major at the University of California Riverside.  My dream job title would be to work in a Museum as a curator.  I am specifically interested in the 20th century of the United States. I would like to work in a museum that focuses on US history.  I am also planning to minor in political science.  If I don't get a job as a historian then I would like to work in local government.  I am mainly interested in public policy. These are things I have been interested in since I was small<br><br>

        Growing up History was my favorite subject and I was so fascinated to learn more about it. When I was around 14 years old I got really into politics .During the 2020 presidential election I was a volunteer for the Bernie Sanders campaign. I was only about 16 years old at the time so my volunteering was limited, I mainly made phone calls on behalf of the  Bernie Sanders Campaign asking for monetary donations and support. That is why I am very passionate about My major and my possible minor. I am currently taking a History class that I really enjoy. During the Winter quarter I took a world politics class that was really interesting. But taking that class made me realize I would prefer learning and practicing local government rather than any international relations. I am only a first year student, but thankfully I am already halfway done with my degree. This is because I took college classes when I was in high school. I was part of a program called RECHS which stands for Rubidoux Early College High School. Rubidoux was the name of my school. It was a dual enrollment program. This allowed me to be enrolled in both high school, and my local community college.<br><br>

        It was during high school that I took my first college U.S history class. I appreciate that I was able to do this because it helped me decide my major when entering college. When I graduated high school I got an award for my recognition in public service.  I have been volunteering in my community since I was about 13 years old.  I started doing local park cleanups and would help in my school library.  Eventually I started helping in actual nonprofits. One of my favorite volunteer Works was working with Jurupa valleys holiday food drive. I would help set out tables and organize food and clothes. Then families would come in and I'd talk to them and walk them through and help them get food and clothes for them to take home. After that I joined a Tutoring Club called The Homework help Club. I along with other volunteers would help students from kindergarten to 9th grade with any academic work for free. Whatever line of work I end up doing I will be happy if I am able to help people..Whether it is working in a museum or in local government.
